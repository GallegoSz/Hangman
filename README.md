## 📝 **Description**
This project consists of creating an interactive hangman game, developed in Java. Hangman is a 
guessing game where one player chooses a secret word, and another tries to guess the letters of 
that word with a limited number of tries. The objective of the project was to recreate this dynamic 
in a digital way, using initial concepts of modular programming and encapsulation while I am still 
learning and consolidating these fundamentals.

The game interface is text-based, allowing the user to play directly on the terminal or console. 
The game selects a word entered by a player and presents it as a set of strokes. The other player 
tries to guess, and for each mistake, 1 is subtracted from the total chances (There are 6 chances in total). 
The game ends when the odds reach 0 (defeat) or the word is guessed (victory).
